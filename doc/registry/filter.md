# Registered Filter Plugins

The filter identifier is designed to be a unique identifier for the filter. Values from zero through 32,767 are reserved for filters supported by The HDF Group in the HDF5 library and for filters requested and supported by the 3rd party.

Values from 32768 to 65535 are reserved for non-distributed uses (e.g., internal company usage) or for application usage when testing a feature. The HDF Group does not track or document the usage of filters with identifiers from this range.

Please contact the maintainer of a filter for help with the plugin.

| BZIP2 | 307 | **BZIP2 lossless compression used by PyTables** bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression. | [bzip2](http://www.bzip.org/), [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) |  [Francesc Alted](mailto:faltet@pytables.org) |
| LZF | 32000 | **LZF lossless compression used by H5Py project** The LZF filter is an alternative DEFLATE-style compressor for HDF5 datasets, using the free LZF library by Marc Alexander Lehmann. Its main benefit over the built-in HDF5 DEFLATE filter is speed; in memory-to-memory operation as part of the filter pipeline, it typically compresses 3x-5x faster than DEFLATE, and decompresses 2x faster, while maintaining 50% to 90% of the DEFLATE compression ratio. LZF can be used to compress any data type, and requires no compile-time or run-time configuration. HDF5 versions 1.6.5 through 1.8.3 are supported. The filter is written in C and can be included directly in C or C++ applications; it has no external dependencies. The license is 3-clause BSD (virtually unrestricted, including commercial applications). The LZF filter was developed as part of the `h5py` project, which implements a general-purpose interface to HDF5 from Python. More information, downloads, and benchmarks, are available [here](http://h5py.org/lzf/). | [`h5py`](http://h5py.org), [LZF](http://home.schmorp.de/marc/liblzf.html) | [Andrew Collette](http://h5py.org) |
| BLOSC | 32001 | **Blosc lossless compression used by PyTables** Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been designed to compress data very fast, at the expense of achieving lesser compression ratios than, say, zlib+shuffle. It is mainly meant to not introduce a significant delay when dealing with data that is stored in high-performance I/O systems (like large RAID cabinets, or even the OS filesystem memory cache). It uses advanced cache-efficient techniques to reduce activity on the memory bus as much as possible. It also leverages SIMD (SSE2) and multi-threading capabilities present in nowadays multi-core processors so as to accelerate the compression/decompression process to a maximum. | [blosc](http://blosc.org/), [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) |  [Francesc Alted](mailto:faltet@pytables.org) |
| MAFISC | 32002 | **Modified LZMA compression filter, MAFISC (Multidimensional Adaptive Filtering Improved Scientific data Compression)** This compressing filter exploits the multidimensionality and smoothness characterizing many scientific data sets. It adaptively applies some filters to preprocess the data and uses lzma as the actual compression step. It significantly outperforms pure lzma compression on most datasets. The software is currently under a rather unrestrictive two clause BSD style license. | [Link](http://wr.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/research/projects/icomex/mafisc) | [Nathanael Huebbe](mailto:nathanael.huebbe@informatik.uni-hamburg.de)
| Snappy | 32003 | **Snappy lossless compression** Snappy-CUDA is a compression/decompression library that leverages GPU processing power to compress/decompress data. The Snappy compression algorithm does not aim for maximum compression or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, the reference implementation of Snappy on the CPU is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. | [snappy-cuda](https://github.com/lucasvr/snappy-cuda), [snappy](https://github.com/google/snappy) | [Lucas C. Villa Real](mailto:lucasvr@gmail.com)
| LZ4 | 32004 | **LZ4 fast lossless compression** LZ4 is a very fast lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed at 300 MB/s per core, scalable with multi-cores CPU. It also features an extremely fast decoder, with speeds up and beyond 1GB/s per core, typically reaching RAM speed limits on multi-core systems. For a format description of the LZ4 compression filter in HDF5, see [here](https://support.hdfgroup.org/services/filters/HDF5_LZ4.pdf). | [Source](https://github.com/nexusformat/HDF5-External-Filter-Plugins/tree/master/LZ4) | [Michael Rissi (Dectris Ltd.)](mailto:michael.rissi@dectris.com) |

| zfp | 32013	| **Rate, accuracy or precision bounded compression for floating-point arrays** zfp is a BSD licensed open source C++ library for compressed floating-point arrays that support very high throughput read and write random access. zfp was designed to achieve high compression ratios and therefore uses lossy but optionally error-bounded compression. Although bit-for-bit lossless compression is not always possible, zfp is usually accurate to within machine epsilon in near-lossless mode, and is often orders of magnitude more accurate and faster than other lossy compressors. | [Link](https://github.com/LLNL/H5Z-ZFP), [Info](http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/floating-point-compression/) | [Mark Miller](mailto:miller86@llnl.gov), [Peter Lindstrom](mailto:pl@llnl.gov) |
| fpzip | 32014	| **Fast and Efficient Lossy or Lossless Compressor for Floating-Point Data** fpzip is a library for lossless or lossy compression of 2D or 3D floating-point scalar fields. Although written in C++, fpzip has a C interface. fpzip was developed by Peter Lindstrom at LLNL. | [Link](http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/floating-point-compression/) | [Peter Lindstrom](mailto:pl@llnl.gov) |
