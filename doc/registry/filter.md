# Registered Filter Plugins

The filter identifier is designed to be a unique identifier for the filter. Values from zero through 32,767 are reserved for filters supported by The HDF Group in the HDF5 library and for filters requested and supported by the 3rd party.

Values from 32768 to 65535 are reserved for non-distributed uses (e.g., internal company usage) or for application usage when testing a feature. The HDF Group does not track or document the usage of filters with identifiers from this range.

Please contact the maintainer of a filter for help with the plugin.

| LZO  | 305 | LZO lossless compression used by PyTables | <ul><li>LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.</li><li>Reliable and thoroughly tested. High adoption - each second terrabytes of data are compressed by LZO. No bugs since the first release back in 1996.</li><li>Offers pretty fast compression and *extremely* fast decompression.</li><li>Includes slower compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high speed.</li><li>Distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL v2+). Commercial licenses are available on request.</li><li>Military-grade stability and robustness.</li></ul> | [LZO](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/), [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) | [Francesc Alted](mailto:faltet@pytables.org) |
| BZIP2 | 307 | BZIP2 lossless compression used by PyTables | bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor. It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available techniques (the PPM family of statistical compressors), whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six times faster at decompression. | [bzip2](http://www.bzip.org/), [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) |  [Francesc Alted](mailto:faltet@pytables.org) |
| LZF | 32000 | LZF lossless compression used by H5Py project | The LZF filter is an alternative DEFLATE-style compressor for HDF5 datasets, using the free LZF library by Marc Alexander Lehmann. Its main benefit over the built-in HDF5 DEFLATE filter is speed; in memory-to-memory operation as part of the filter pipeline, it typically compresses 3x-5x faster than DEFLATE, and decompresses 2x faster, while maintaining 50% to 90% of the DEFLATE compression ratio. LZF can be used to compress any data type, and requires no compile-time or run-time configuration. HDF5 versions 1.6.5 through 1.8.3 are supported. The filter is written in C and can be included directly in C or C++ applications; it has no external dependencies. The license is 3-clause BSD (virtually unrestricted, including commercial applications). The LZF filter was developed as part of the `h5py` project, which implements a general-purpose interface to HDF5 from Python. More information, downloads, and benchmarks, are available [here](http://h5py.org/lzf/). | [`h5py`](http://h5py.org), [LZF](http://home.schmorp.de/marc/liblzf.html) | [Andrew Collette](http://h5py.org) |
| BLOSC | 32001 | Blosc lossless compression used by PyTables | Blosc is a high performance compressor optimized for binary data. It has been designed to compress data very fast, at the expense of achieving lesser compression ratios than, say, zlib+shuffle. It is mainly meant to not introduce a significant delay when dealing with data that is stored in high-performance I/O systems (like large RAID cabinets, or even the OS filesystem memory cache). It uses advanced cache-efficient techniques to reduce activity on the memory bus as much as possible. It also leverages SIMD (SSE2) and multi-threading capabilities present in nowadays multi-core processors so as to accelerate the compression/decompression process to a maximum. | [blosc](http://blosc.org/), [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/) |  [Francesc Alted](mailto:faltet@pytables.org) |
| MAFISC | 32002 | Modified LZMA compression filter, MAFISC (Multidimensional Adaptive Filtering Improved Scientific data Compression) | This compressing filter exploits the multidimensionality and smoothness characterizing many scientific data sets. It adaptively applies some filters to preprocess the data and uses lzma as the actual compression step. It significantly outperforms pure lzma compression on most datasets. The software is currently under a rather unrestrictive two clause BSD style license. | [Link](http://wr.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/research/projects/icomex/mafisc) | [Nathanael Huebbe](mailto:nathanael.huebbe@informatik.uni-hamburg.de)
